Through a wide-ranging presentation of media, including a series of paintings, sculptures, drawings and writings, the viewer will become acquainted with the artist's working method. This is a project that explores a common theme or philosophy. By delving into the collective subconscious and the psyche, Regehr produces images of an intensely personal nature, which invites reciprocal identification by the viewer. In pairing both visual art and poetry, this exhibition brings to life this remarkable artist's investigations of the notions of transformation and metamorphosis. Recent series ""Omiscience"", ""Revenant"" and ""Doppelganger"" reflect a new intensity and the scale of Regehr's reflection on the human experience and brings together the recurring leitmotifs of his work. Regehr was awarded an honorary degree from the University of Victoria in 2008 for his accomplishments in theatre and fine arts.  The Legacy Art Gallery is pleased to feature the work of this distinguished honorand.

","Deirdre Logue (from Toronto, ON) is in Victoria this summer participating in a production residency and solo exhibition at Open Space in partnership with MediaNet. Logue will work from a temporary studio, located on site, for the next couple of months preparing for an exhibition of new and recent works. Logue is known for her critically engaged self-portraits and performance-based installations, which are infused with a keen sense of humour. Her works explore issues of queer, psychoanalytic, and feminist theory, employing experimental and minimalist production methods to challenge ideas of self-representation. Logue will continue her exploration of these themes in the context of Victoria’s cultural community and share with us her experiences. ""Open Space has offered me a truly unique engagement; the chance to both produce and present in the same environment, compressing the often forced and generally problematic distances between artist, exhibition space and public. For both the studio component and the show, I hope to unpack the autobiographical notion for a closer examination of the creative process, the labour of existence and the unsettled present tense.' – Deirdre Logue
During her time in Victoria, Logue will participate in the symposium Representing the Personal, hosted by MediaNet, June 21 and 22 and set up a satellite Feminist Art Gallery, a project that she codirects with Allyson Mitchell. Logue and Mitchell are contributors to the international conference Civil Partnerships? Queer and Feminist Curating at the Tate Modern in London, UK, May 17 to 19.

Event: ""the woods"" Opening @ G++ Interactive Media Gallery
Who: Annie Briard wi/ Limbic Media
Description: ""the woods"" is a handmade stop-motion world, explorable by the viewer via mobile devices and the web, in a ‘choose your own adventure’ style. The work features a character living within her personal enchanted forest. Viewers can interact with her through text and movement, prompting different fable-like narrative moments and actions. Though on-site interaction with the animated video is encouraged from G++ Gallery's street-front windows, viewers may also interact with each other and access the work remotely via a website featuring a live video feed. 
Along with engaging passersby with its unique aesthetic and playful interactivity, Briard's work also prompts contemplation about the way we relate to one another and our environment, while investigating theories around the use of the uncanny and wonderment in moving-image art. Annie Briard is a Canadian interdisciplinary artist holding a BFA from Concordia University (2008), and currently undertaking an MFA at Emily Carr University in Vancouver. Focusing on reality-perception and environmental relationships, Briard produces work in digital and handmade moving-image, installation, painting/drawing, sculpture and interactive media.
Briard has exhibited across Canada and internationally, notably at Studio XX, HTMlles media arts biennale, Nuit Blanche and Art Souterrain Festival, Montreal; the White Rabbit Arts Festival, Halifax; the Three Shadows Photography Art Centre (Beijing, China) and eMerge Media Space (Townsville, Australia), amongst others. Her work was featured in a 10-city tour of China for the “Canadian Cameras at Work” showcase in 2009-2011. In 2011, Joyce Yahouda Gallery presented “The Space in Between,” a solo show of her work. Briard has just completed an arts residency and exhibition at the Banff Centre in Alberta this summer and will be participating in the World Event Young Artists exhibition and symposium in England this coming fall. Annie Briard is represented in Canada by Joyce Yahouda Gallery. www.AnnieBriard.com

This is the fifth and final project in G++’s Interactive Media Series. The series paired five media artists with the team of interaction designers and engineers at Limbic Media to produce five interactive window-front media installations. The Interactive Film & Video Series at G++ was made possible through the joint BC Film/BC Arts Council Interactive Fund.

Born in England in 1935, Robert McVittie became one of the most celebrated marine artists in North America. As a young man he attended the Thames Nautical Training College, an institution dating back to the 19th century that was designed to provide training for officers in a sea-going career. He entered the Merchant Navy and worked on freighters, travelling the high seas of the world for several years. During this time he commenced drawing and sketching the scenes around him as a means of “recording” his experiences. Throughout his many years as an artist, McVittie achieved numerous accomplishments including becoming President of the Canadian Society of Marine Artists and receiving a commission by Northwest Territories Commissioner, Stuart Hodgson, to portray the marine history of the N.W.T. His beautiful paintings have also graced the collections of Her Majesty Queen Elizabeth, various Heads of State and numerous corporate collections.

Housed in the top floor of the city's first fire hall and named to reflect the history of this building and its original inhabitants, Deluge represents a vanguard of visual and media arts in Victoria. In addition to comprehensive solo and group exhibitions at the gallery, our ongoing program of activities includes lectures, screenings, off-site projects and the annual Antimatter Film Festival.","Deluge presents: Sarah Gee: I Have Nothing to Say and I Am Saying It. ""I use collaged paper to compose what could be called geometric abstraction, but I sometimes think of it as heretical geometry - formalism combined with the psychedelic. Paper is a kind of everyman material, both modest and dynamic, capable of anything. Dangerously exacting, it lets me work quickly and intuitively, moving shapes around until the right note has been struck. Even though I use collage techniques, my work, with its strong hues and sleek surfaces, relates more to pop serigraph than traditional cut-and-paste. My work is utopian in nature, rational, harmonious, and balanced. Rather than narratives or emotional gestures, I'm presenting a kind of transcendentalism. Blazing colour is contained within precision and structure, and the effect is something that is loud and silent at the same time. The colour sings, but the content is mute. This is why I take a quote from experimental musician John Cage as the title of this exhibition. Cage famously took himself out of the equation, suggesting any meaning must be found and understood only by the viewer."" - Sarah Gee, June, 2012. Sarah Gee is an artist living and working in Vancouver BC. Primarily working with collaged paper, her geometric compositions are kaleidoscopic, harmonious and pensive. Concerned with regularity and equilibrium, her work strives toward a kind of transcendental austerity augmented by dazzling color. Continually experimenting, she has recently completed a series of scorched-paper images as well as large-scale discs abstracting a city block into a series of sequential color bands.
